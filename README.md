# ILOC (Incremental Learning on Chip)
Hardware implementation of BRIL, an incremental learning on chip introduced in http://www.vincent-gripon.com/files/conf/2017-SIPS.pdf and http://www.vincent-gripon.com/files/conf/2017-GlobalSip3.pdf.
This implementation is described using VHDL. It uses Cifar-10 dataset and achieves an accuracy of 81% with 200 anchor vectors, when learning incrementally one example at a time.
